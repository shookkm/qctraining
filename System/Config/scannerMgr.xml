         At least one Scanner element must be defined.  The following are 
         REQUIRED:
             id (scanner number)
             name
             destination (for forwarding read notice)

         The following are required if not specified in the Scanners element:
             noRead
             noData
             multiRead

         The following are optional and will override the settings in the 
         Scanners element:
             generateSeqNo (default is false)
             inductNotice (setting to empty string will result in no notice)

         The following are completely optional:
             filterClassName (to filter data coming from PLC prior to forwarding)
             hostName (if data is coming directly from scanner IP)
